Datathon Challenge 2023

## Inspiration
Inspired by the potential within healthcare data that our beloved NTT gave us, our project emerged from a desire to unravel the mysteries that lie beneath the surface of a certain's product quantity over time. Recognizing the power of data analytics, we set out on a journey to analyze and predict, driven by the profound belief that within these datasets, a roadmap to better health and well-being awaits discovery. Our inspiration stems from the untapped potential to transform raw data into actionable insights, ultimately shaping a future where predictive analytics guides us toward personalized and proactive healthcare. Join us on this quest to decipher the language of data and unlock a new era of health understanding.
## What it does
Our project is dedicated to offering a glimpse into the future of product quantity needs in 2023, utilizing advanced predictive analytics. By meticulously modeling purchase patterns and combinations, we've harnessed the power of data to forecast with precision. Beyond mere prediction, our primary objective is to craft a robust purchase plan for 2023, ensuring organizations can navigate the upcoming year with strategic insight and informed decision-making. In essence, we've delved into the intricacies of data to not only anticipate quantities but to empower businesses with a proactive strategy for a successful 2023.

In our pursuit of accurate predictions, we subjected our data to meticulous scrutiny, employing sophisticated techniques such as histogram plotting. This in-depth analysis allowed us to unravel nuanced insights and gain a comprehensive understanding of the underlying patterns. Moreover, recognizing the importance of data quality, we dedicated considerable effort to preprocess the information. By refining and preparing the data meticulously, we ensured that every piece of information contributed meaningfully to our predictive models, enhancing the overall accuracy and value of our analyses."
## How we built it
In crafting our predictive model for the product quantities in 2023, we employed cutting-edge techniques, including the implementation of a fully-connected neural network. This sophisticated neural network architecture allowed us to capture intricate relationships and dependencies within the data, enabling more accurate predictions for the upcoming year. Additionally, we leveraged widely-used and reliable tools such as pandas, matplotlib, and numpy, integrating these standard libraries seamlessly into our framework. These tools played a crucial role in data manipulation, visualization, and array operations, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of our modeling process. By combining advanced neural network methodologies with well-established libraries, we've established a robust foundation for precise predictions and insightful analyses in our pursuit of forecasting product quantities for 2023. Additionally, we optimized our model's performance by incorporating Principal Component Analysis (PCA) trying to efficiently reduce dimensionality, enhancing the overall accuracy and efficiency of our forecasting framework.
## Challenges we ran into
One notable challenge we encountered during the project was the emergence of persistent errors in the validation set, typically hovering in the range of 0.5 to 0.4. Addressing this issue became crucial during the model training phase, as normalization and regularization efforts were initially causing complications. Despite our best efforts to normalize the data and regulate values, the training error converged but not necessarily around the desired value of 0. However, our tenacity prevailed, and through strategic adjustments, we managed to overcome this hurdle. The model, though presented with deviated samples, demonstrated its resilience, ensuring functionality in predicting outcomes.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We take pride in successfully training a model that performed yielding valuable insights within the dataset. Despite the inherent challenges and the fact that we are relatively new to this domain, our team's determination and dedication allowed us to navigate the complexities. The outcomes achieved underscore our commitment to learning and adapting, showcasing the potential even in our early stages. This experience not only marks a significant milestone but also propels us forward with newfound confidence and expertise in the realm of data analysis and predictive modeling.
## What we learned
Our journey involved a substantial learning curve as we delved into techniques using TensorFlow and other libraries previously unfamiliar to us. The process of exploring and implementing these advanced tools not only fortified our understanding of data analysis but also expanded our knowledge in the dynamic realm of data science. This hands-on experience not only enhanced our skill set but also broadened our perspective, empowering us to tackle complex challenges with newfound proficiency. Our commitment to continuous learning has proven instrumental in elevating our expertise within the ever-evolving landscape of the data world.
